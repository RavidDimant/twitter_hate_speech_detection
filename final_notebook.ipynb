    "Human content moderation exploits people by consistently traumatizing and underpaying them. In 2019, an [article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) on The Verge exposed the extensive list of horrific working conditions that employees faced at Cognizant, which was Facebook’s primary moderation contractor. Unfortunately, every major tech company, including Twitter, uses human moderators to some extent, both domestically and overseas.\n",

    "The dataset for this capstone project was sourced from a study called Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language  conducted by Thomas Davidson and a team at Cornell University in 2017. The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language). The dataset is provided as a `.csv` file with 24,802 text posts from Twitter where 6% of the tweets were labeled as hate speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since content moderation is so subjective, the labels on this dataset were crowdsourced and determined by majority-rules. The “class” column labels each tweet as 0 for hate speech, 1 for offensive language or 2 for neither. In order to create a different project and adapt the data to my specific business context, I will be treating the data as a binary classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the final model will be **predicting whether a tweet is hate speech or not.** To prepare the data for this, I will be manually replacing existing 1 and 2 values as 0, and replacing 0 as 1 to indicate hate speech."
